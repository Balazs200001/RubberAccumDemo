# PLAN

Source of truth for scope. Supersedes the milestone dates in `project-proposal.md` section 6.
The proposal's *content* still stands; only its calendar does not.

Revised 2026-09-21 (start of week 4).

## Where the project actually is

Weeks 1-3 produced the proposal and three git repositories. No system code exists. The plugin is
an empty two-module skeleton. The week 2 feasibility gate never ran, so every number in the
proposal's architecture argument is still an estimate rather than a measurement.

Against the proposal's schedule that is M1, M2 and M3 outstanding with M3 due now.

## How this plan differs

Decided 2026-09-21: **nothing is cut**, and the work is re-cast as a dependency-ordered backlog
rather than week-locked milestones. Progress is judged at checkpoints against tasks completed, not
against a date the task was supposed to land on.

The cut list from the proposal (section "Work that can be removed, in order") is retained
unchanged as contingency. It is not invoked. If a checkpoint shows the backlog is not closing,
that list is the order things come off, and the decision is recorded here when it happens.

**Stated plainly, because it has to be defensible:** four weeks remain for six weeks of planned
work, and the least familiar part of the engine (the game-thread/render-thread split) is still
ahead. Carrying full scope is the user's call, made with that known. The purpose of the
checkpoints below is to make the consequence visible early enough to act on.

### Checkpoint: Wednesday 2026-09-24

Review scope against completed tasks. No cut decision before then.

## Ordering principle

Each phase ends in something observable. A phase is done when its exit condition is demonstrated,
not when its code compiles.

Phase B is first past foundations because it is the measurement the whole architecture rests on,
and it is cheaper to take now than to discover in phase G that the region strategy was wrong.

---

## Phase A — Public API and subsystem foundations

No engine-uncertain work. Everything here is shared by both candidate storage backends, so none
of it is wasted whichever way the phase B gate resolves.

| # | Task | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | `EAccumulationChannel`, `FSurfaceContact`, `FSurfaceStateSample` | Types compile standalone, no vehicle dependency |
| A2 | `FSurfaceRegion`: world bounds to normalised UV to texel, with a defined out-of-region result | Unit-testable pure math |
| A3 | `USurfaceAccumulationSubsystem` as a `UWorldSubsystem`, lifetime and region config | Subsystem instantiates with a world, logs its region |
| A4 | Write API `RegisterSurfaceContact`, with contact interpolation over *distance* | A contact at 55 m/s at 30 fps leaves a continuous streak, not dots |
| A5 | Per-frame contact queue and flush | Queue drains, ordering defined |
| A6 | `Build.cs` dependencies, `RACETRACKSURFACE_API` only where needed | Plugin builds in isolation via `RunUAT BuildPlugin` |
| A7 | Blueprint callable wrappers over the public API | Callable from a Blueprint actor |

*Exit: the write API exists, is callable from C++ and Blueprint, and stores nothing yet.*

**Status 2026-09-22: complete.** Builds in isolation (`BuildPlugin`), as the unity game target, and
as the editor target. Twelve automation tests pass headlessly. Not verified: A7 has not been
exercised from an actual Blueprint graph, only compiled, because no map exists in `Content/` yet.
Carried into phase C.

## Phase B — Feasibility gate (owed from week 2)

The measurement that the architecture argument depends on.

Amended 2026-09-22, B3 method. The original plan said to drive `stat GPU` and the CSV profiler
through MCP. The UE 5.8 toolsets expose no console-command or CVar-set tool — `EditorAppToolset`
offers `SearchCVars` for lookup only, and nothing anywhere executes a console command. So
`stat GPU`, `CsvProfile` and `FreezeRendering` are not reachable from MCP at all.

B3 instead times the passes directly with RHI timestamp queries inside a C++ automation test:
`RHICreateRenderQuery(RQT_AbsoluteTime)` bracketing each pass, read back with
`RHIGetRenderQueryResult`, gated on the RHI's timestamp-query support flag. This is a better
measurement than the original anyway: it isolates the passes under test rather than the whole
frame, returns a number in a log rather than one read off a screenshot, and re-runs unattended for
the later profiling passes in D6, E6 and H4. Run headlessly via `UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe`, and from
the live editor via `AutomationTestToolset`.

| # | Task | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | Persistent render target allocated and drawn into by the canvas path | A streak persists across frames — **met** |
| B2 | Receiving material function sampling by world position (authored through `MaterialTools` over MCP, logged in `EDITOR_SETUP.md`) | Streak visible on a surface — **met** |
| B3 | Measure: one paint call, N paint calls, full-buffer decay pass, via RHI timestamp queries in an automation test | Real numbers recorded in `docs/MEASUREMENTS.md` |
| B4 | Area vs texel density decision: region size, memory, channel count, precision | Decision recorded with the numbers behind it |
| B5 | Decide saturating accumulator: hardware blend vs double buffer | Decision recorded |
| B6 | Channel packing, with the constraint that skid and buildup are sampleable together | Layout recorded |

*Gate: four contact points at 60 Hz within roughly 0.5 ms GPU on a 4070 without batching. If not,
the flush strategy is redesigned before anything else is built. If no usable region size fits
memory at skid-mark density, the region strategy changes here.*

**Status 2026-09-22: PHASE B COMPLETE.** Gate passed, B1 to B6 all demonstrated.

Four contacts cost 0.3610 ms and 0.3040 ms across two runs, inside the 0.5 ms budget unbatched.
The flush strategy is not redesigned. Numbers and reasoning in
[MEASUREMENTS.md](MEASUREMENTS.md).

Decisions taken:

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| B4 | 2048 square RGBA16f over a 200 m region, 32 MiB, 9.77 cm per texel. 4096 square stays configurable at 128 MiB |
| B5 | Additive write of an unbounded exposure value, saturation applied at sample time. Rejects both hardware-blend saturation and the double buffer |
| B6 | One RGBA16f target: R buildup, G skid, B marbles, A unused and not writable through the canvas path |

Two findings that change later phases:

- **Paint cost is per contact, not per texel**, at roughly 0.075 ms per contact and flat across a
  64-fold range of buffer sizes. Eighty contacts costs 5.0 to 6.0 ms. **Batching moves from phase H
  to a prerequisite of phase C**: unbatched, the harness supports about six cars, not the twenty
  that C3 and E7 need. Added as C0 below.
- **A 1500 m circuit does not fit in one region at any resolution measured.** 4096 square still
  gives 36.62 cm per texel over 1500 m. The single-region design is a 200 m instrument, and the
  circuit case needs a following region or tiling. Folded into D5.

### B1 and B2 exit conditions, demonstrated 2026-09-22

Both were outstanding at the start of the day and both are now met, in
`/Game/Maps/L_SurfaceVerification` with `ASurfaceVerificationRig` sweeping one contact at
5500 cm/s across a 200 m plane.

- **B1, "a streak persists across frames": met.** A single frame paints roughly 92 cm of stroke.
  The captured frame shows an unbroken mark spanning the full 160 m sweep, so every frame before it
  is still in the buffer. That is the persistence proof, in one frame, without needing two.
- **B2, "streak visible on a surface": met.** The mark renders green, which is the G channel, which
  is `EAccumulationChannel::SkidMark`. The channel mask, the world-position-to-region-UV mapping
  and the saturation mapping are therefore all doing what they were built to do, because any one of
  them being wrong gives a black surface, a mark in the wrong place, or the wrong colour.

The run also confirms two earlier decisions are actually live rather than merely recorded:

```
LogRacetrackSurface: Published region centre (0.0, 0.0), world size 20000.0
                     and saturation constant 3.000 to MPC_RacetrackSurface
LogRacetrackSurface: Accumulation buffer allocated at 2048 x 2048, 33554432 bytes
```

33554432 bytes over 2048 square is 8 bytes per texel, so the B4 and B6 choice of RGBA16f is in
force, not just written down.

**Not verified.** The saturation curve itself is unmeasured. The mark is visibly bright, which
proves the mapping is being applied at all, but nothing distinguishes a coverage of 0.95 from one
of 3.98 on screen. `ExposureToCoverage` has no automation test, and it is now the contract between
the material and the phase F query path.

### Where the saturation constant lives, decided 2026-09-22

B5 left `1 - exp(-k * E)` needing the same `k` in the material and in the phase F query path.

`RacetrackSurfaceMapping::SaturationConstant` in `SurfaceAccumulationMapping.h` is the single
source of truth, at **3.0**. `ExposureToCoverage` beside it is what phase F calls directly.
`USurfaceAccumulationSubsystem` pushes the constant, the region centre and the region world size
into `MPC_RacetrackSurface` on `ConfigureRegion` and on first buffer allocation, and the material
function reads them as collection parameters. Nothing is typed into the graph, and the collection
asset defaults `k` to 0 so that a missing push shows up as no coverage anywhere rather than as a
stale second copy that quietly works.

3.0 is derived from B6 rather than chosen for looks: at the 0.002 per contact buildup increment
that the RGBA8 precision floor ruled out, 500 contacts give an exposure of 1.0, which maps to 0.95
coverage.

**Not verified.** The mapping has never been evaluated against a real buffer. That is what the
outstanding visual check is for, and no automation test covers `ExposureToCoverage` yet.

## Phase C — Test harness

Validation instrument, not demo dressing. Needed before D and E can be judged at all, because
buildup takes dozens of laps and marbles hundreds.

| # | Task | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| C0 | Batch the per-frame strokes into one draw rather than one draw per contact. Added 2026-09-22 from the B3 measurement | Eighty contacts within the four-contact budget |
| C1 | Spline-generated track | Closed circuit in the level |
| C2 | Autonomous spline-following cars, no physics, driving the public API only | Cars lap unattended |
| C3 | Per-position speed and slip curves, lateral offset per car | Traffic spreads across the line |
| C4 | Time compression with lap counter | 50 laps in about two minutes |
| C5 | Fixed-camera observation mode | Repeatable identical load per run |

*Exit: press play, walk away, come back to a marked track.*

## Phase D — Skid marks at product quality

| # | Task | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Velocity-oriented rotated brush quad, narrow | Marks align with travel direction |
| D2 | Immediate write: darken, drop roughness | Reads as a lockup mark |
| D3 | Defined behaviour at the region edge | Defined, not accidental |
| D4 | Save, reload, reset | State survives a round trip |
| D5 | Behaviour under World Partition streaming | Correct across a streaming boundary |
| D6 | First profiling pass | Numbers in `MEASUREMENTS.md` |

*Exit: correct under streaming, saving and reset, not only in a clean single level.*

## Phase E — Emergent racing line and the decay coupling

The clearest proof the mechanism works, and the reason to prioritise it over marbles.

| # | Task | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| E1 | Buildup channel, saturating accumulator | Approaches a ceiling rather than clipping |
| E2 | Decay pass over real time, frequency as a cost knob | Line fades over a session |
| E3 | Wash-out call for users to hook to rain | One call, measurable effect |
| E4 | Roughness and specular change with slight darkening, verified under Lumen and baked | Reads as laid rubber under both |
| E5 | **The coupling**: skid decay rate as a function of local buildup | Marks on the line are paved over, marks off it persist |
| E6 | Second profiling pass, focused on the decay pass | Numbers recorded |
| E7 | Validation: two identical marks, traffic over one only, compare intensity | A number, not an impression |

*Exit: a racing line that appears from being driven on, and a measured difference in skid
persistence on the line against off it.*

## Phase F — Query path

The half of the project that turns accumulation from an effect into a mechanic.

| # | Task | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| F1 | Gather compute pass sampling the targets at submitted positions | Averages a contact patch, not one texel |
| F2 | Readback ring with last-known-value cache | No stall, no stale-read crash |
| F3 | Local cache for an actor's own contacts (the 45 ms axle case) | Own contacts not subject to readback delay |
| F4 | Read API `QuerySurfaceState` against the buildup channel | Correct and defined values |
| F5 | Debug overlay drawing returned values beside the surface they came from | Wrong sample position is visible, not assumed absent |
| F6 | Measured latency in frames, and query cost at 4 and at 80 contact points | Tolerance argued in the proposal demonstrated |
| F7 | Survives level load, hitches, actor destruction | Decides readback vs grid |

*Fallback: the CPU grid, roughly an afternoon, public API unchanged. Taken only if F7 fails.*

*Exit: the query returns correct values and the debug overlay agrees with what is drawn.*

## Phase G — Marble distribution and marble query

| # | Task | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | Cellular-noise clumping, threshold onset rather than linear | Clumps, not a gradient |
| G2 | Placement offset from travel path, density driven by buildup in adjacent cells | Band on the outside of corners, no authored line |
| G3 | Clearing when cars drive through | Repeated passes open a path |
| G4 | Channel wired into the query path | Per-wheel readout changes as a car crosses the band |

*Exit: correct spatial distribution as flat texture variation, plus a working readout.*

## Phase H — Marble volume, hardening, demo map

| # | Task | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| H1 | POM driven by the marble height mask | Convincing volume at close range |
| H2 | Step count as a scalability setting, distance fade to flat | Degrades gracefully |
| H3 | Scalability tiers wired to the standard system | Standard console variables work |
| H4 | Final profiling pass | Numbers recorded |
| H5 | Demo map: material and lighting swaps, a recognisable car, a drivable pawn | Fast-forward control prominent |

## Phase I — Communication and release

Reserved. No new features.

- Final presentation: five minutes, four slides, live demonstration
- Public technical write-up
- Fab listing, clean install verified into a fresh project
- Fixed-camera timelapse of one braking zone evolving

---

## Standing rules for this backlog

- A phase is not complete until its exit condition has been demonstrated, and what was *not*
  verified is stated.
- Every measurement goes in `docs/MEASUREMENTS.md` with the build configuration it came from.
  Development or Shipping, never editor, because editor frame-rate smoothing hides the spikes.
- Every editor-side change goes in `docs/EDITOR_SETUP.md`.
- Learning log evidence is added as work happens, not in week 8.
